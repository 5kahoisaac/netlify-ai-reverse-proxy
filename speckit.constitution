# Speckit Constitution

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Write code that is immediately understandable
- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and premature optimization

### 2. Consistency Standards
- Follow established coding conventions and style guides
- Maintain consistent patterns across the codebase
- Use automated formatting tools (prettier, eslint, etc.)
- Document deviations from standards with clear reasoning

### 3. Maintainability First
- Write modular, loosely coupled components
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Refactor regularly to prevent technical debt accumulation

## Testing Standards

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Write tests before or alongside feature implementation
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for component interactions

### 5. Test Quality Requirements
- Tests must be fast, reliable, and deterministic
- Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- Isolate tests from external dependencies using mocks/stubs
- Regularly review and update test suites

### 6. Testing Pyramid Adherence
- Prioritize unit tests (70%) for business logic
- Include integration tests (20%) for component interactions
- Maintain minimal end-to-end tests (10%) for critical user flows
- Automate all tests in CI/CD pipeline

## User Experience Consistency

### 7. Interface Uniformity
- Maintain consistent visual design patterns
- Use standardized component libraries and design systems
- Ensure consistent behavior across similar interactions
- Follow platform-specific UI/UX conventions

### 8. Accessibility Requirements
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Implement proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Test with screen readers and assistive technologies

### 9. User-Centered Design
- Validate design decisions with user research and testing
- Prioritize user needs over technical convenience
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Design for progressive disclosure and graceful degradation

## Performance Requirements

### 10. Response Time Standards
- API responses must complete within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Page load times must not exceed 3 seconds on 3G connections
- Interactive elements must respond within 100ms
- Database queries must be optimized and indexed appropriately

### 11. Resource Efficiency
- Minimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks
- Optimize bundle sizes and implement code splitting
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Monitor and profile performance regularly

### 12. Scalability Considerations
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Plan for graceful degradation under load

## Enforcement and Governance

### 13. Code Review Requirements
- All code changes require peer review before merging
- Reviews must verify adherence to these principles
- Automated checks must pass before review approval
- Document exceptions with clear justification

### 14. Continuous Monitoring
- Implement automated quality gates in CI/CD
- Monitor performance metrics in production
- Regular audits of code quality and technical debt
- User experience monitoring and feedback collection

### 15. Evolution and Adaptation
- Review and update constitution quarterly
- Incorporate lessons learned from incidents and retrospectives
- Adapt standards based on technology and team growth
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
